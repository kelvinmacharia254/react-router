## React Router

Exploring React Router

### Traditional routing
The client would request documents from the server, downloads and evaluates
the front-end assets(CSS & JS) then render the HTML.

To request another page, the user would click links and teh whole process would
repeat over and over again.

### Why react Router
Enables client side routing.
Client side routing allows the app to update URL from a link clicks to navigate to
other pages without making server request for assets.

The app is able to load pages UI seamlessly as they users navigate the website and only make data request with fetch to
update the various pages with new information when needed.

Client side routing is powered by creating a router & linking then allowing submission of data
via forms.
